### Dockerizing-a-Node.js-web-app

The goal of this example is to show you how to get a Node.js application into a Docker container. The guide is intended for development, and not for a production deployment. The guide assumes you have a basic understanding of how a Node.js application is structured. We will create a simple web application in Node.js, then we will build a Docker image for that application, and lastly we will instantiate a container from that image.
